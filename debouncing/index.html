    <h1>DEBOUNCING</h1>
    <p>Debouncing is a technique used in web development to optimize performance by ensuring that a function is not invoked too frequently. It's particularly useful when dealing with events that may fire rapidly, such as input events (e.g., typing in a search box), scroll events, or resize events.</p>
    <p>In debouncing, the function is only executed after a certain period of inactivity following the event. If the event occurs again within that period, the previous function call is canceled, and a new timer starts. This effectively postpones the execution of the function until after the event has ceased for a specified duration.</p>
